This tutorial walks you through creating and configuring a new Inverno portfolio from scratch.

## Installation ‚ú®

If you haven't yet installed Inverno, follow the steps [here](https://github.com/werew/inverno/blob/main/docs/installation.md#installation-) to install it.

## Creating a new project üì∞

After installing Inverno, you should have get a new command named `inverno`, try typing it in your terminal of choice:

```sh
$ inverno --help
Usage: inverno [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  gen-report   Generate an html report from a config
  new-project  Generate a template for a new project
```

At the time being Inverno offers two commands `gen-report` and `new-project`.
Let's use the latter to create a new blank portfolio:

```sh
$ mkdir myproject && inverno new-project myproject
```

This should have created a new blank project inside the folder `myproject`:

```sh
$ ls myproject
project.yml  transactions.csv
```

You should now see two files in there: 
 - `project.yml`: a project configuration template
 - `transactions.csv`: an example list of transactions

At the moment the project configuration consists only of a list of transactions (all the rest is commented out):

```yml
transactions:
  - format: standard           # Transactions format
    file: transactions.csv     # Transactions file
```

This tells Inverno to load the transactions in the `transactions.csv` file which contains some example of transactions. 
You can open and edit .csv files using any spreedsheet software such as Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc, etc.

As you can see there are a couple of cash deposits and some purchases of Facebook, Google and Apple stock.

This is enough to generate our first report:

```sh
$ inverno gen-report myproject/project.yml myproject/report
```

```sh
$ ls myproject/report
css  index.html  js  media  node_modules  package.json  package-lock.json  vendor
```

To view it, simply open the `index.html` file using your browser of choice.
You should see something like this:

## Configuring Transactions üí∏

As we saw in the previous section, the project configuration needs a list of transactions.
Transactions are listed in a separate .csv file, which is specified in the config as follows:

```yml
transactions:
  - format: standard           # Transactions format
    file: transactions.csv     # Transactions file
```

CSV files can be edited using any spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel).
You can provide as many transactions files as you want:

```yml
transactions:
  - format: standard
    file: transactions1.csv
  - format: schwab
    file: transactions2.csv
```

The `format` field specifies which format the transaction file is using. 
At the moment the available formats are `standard` and `schwab`. 

The `schwab` format is compatible with the list of transactions exportable from [Charles Schwab](https://schwab.com/) brokerage platform.

If you are manually filling in your transactions you should use the `standard` format.
In this format, each row corresponds to a transaction.

Your transactions file will have the following columns:

- **date**: day the transaction happened (e.g. 10/02/21)
- **action**: type of transaction, available types are:
  - ***buy***: for purchases of new holdings (e.g. buying stock)
  - ***sell***: for selling holdings (e.g. selling stock)
  - ***cash_in***: for cash flowing in (e.g. cash deposit, salary, etc.) 
  - ***cash_out***: for cash flowing out (e.g. withdrowal)
  - ***tax***: for any sort of tax payment associated to the investment account
  - ***vest***: for [vesting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp) events (e.g. from [RSU](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp)) 
  - ***dividends***: for dividends payed by an holding
  - ***split***: for [stock split](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.asp) events
- **name**: (optional) name of the holding, can be anything (e.g. Google, Facebook, MyFund, etc.)
- **ticker**: (optional) ticker of the holding, if applicable (e.g. GOOGL, FB, etc.)
- **isin**: (optional) [ISIN](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isin.asp) of the holding, if applicable (e.g. US38259P7069)
- **quantity**: (needed for buy/sell/vest transactions) number of holdings purchased/sold/vested (e.g. 3.5)
- **price**: (either price or amount are needed for buy/sell transactions) holding price at the moment of the purchase/sale, corresponds to the price multiplied by the quantity (e.g. $102.2)
- **amount**: (either price or amount are needed for buy/sell transactions) total cash amount of the transaction price at the moment of the purchase/sale, corresponds to the price multiplied by the quantity (e.g. $424.2)
- **fees**: (optional) transaction costs (e.g. $2.4)

Once again, here is an example of transactions:

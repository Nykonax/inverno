# Tutorial üßë‚Äçüè´

This tutorial walks you through creating and configuring a new Inverno portfolio from scratch.

## Installation ‚ú®

If you haven't yet installed Inverno, follow the steps [here](https://github.com/werew/inverno/blob/main/docs/installation.md#installation-) to install it.

## Create a new project

After installing Inverno, you should have get a new command named `inverno`, try typing it in your terminal of choice:

```sh
$ inverno --help
Usage: inverno [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  gen-report   Generate an html report from a config
  new-project  Generate a template for a new project
```

At the time being Inverno offers two commands `gen-report` and `new-project`.
Let's use the latter to create a new blank portfolio:

```sh
$ mkdir myproject && inverno new-project myproject
```

This should have created a new blank project inside the folder `myproject`:

```sh
$ ls myproject
project.yml  transactions.csv
```

You should now see two files in there: 
 - `project.yml`: a project configuration template
 - `transactions.csv`: an example list of transactions

At the moment the project configuration consists only of a list of transactions (all the rest is commented out):

```yml
transactions:
  - format: standard           # Transactions format
    file: transactions.csv     # Transactions file
```

This tells Inverno to load the transactions in the `transactions.csv` file which contains some example of transactions. 
You can open and edit .csv files using any spreedsheet software such as Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc, etc.

As you can see there are a couple of cash deposits and some purchases of Facebook, Google and Apple stock.

This is enough to generate our first report:

```sh
$ inverno gen-report myproject/project.yml myproject/report
```

Congrats :) you have just generated your first report in `myproject/report`:

```sh
$ ls myproject/report
css  index.html  js  media  node_modules  package.json  package-lock.json  vendor
```

To view it, simply open the `index.html` file using your browser of choice.

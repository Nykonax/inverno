# This section is optional. If omitted default values are used.

# At the very least you must provide a list of transactions.
# This is used to determine balance and holdings through time.
# You can provide multiple lists of transactions, they will
# be merged and used together.
#
# Each transactions list you specify the format and the file 
# containing the transactions
transactions:
  - format: standard
    file: my_transactions.csv

# Inverno uses several strategies to determine the prices of your 
# holdings (e.g. try fetching them from Yahoo Finance or estimate them 
# from transactions prices).
# Sometime (especially when prices are not available on Yahoo Finance) 
# the strategy to estimate holding prices can lack of precision.
# So you are given the possibility to provide your own price data which,
# if present, is always preferred.
#
# Each entry must have a match section, matching the holding by name or
# ticker, and a specify file where the price data is stored
prices:
    - match:
        name: My Fund
      file: my_fund_prices.csv

# You can provide meta attributes for your holdings. For example,
# you can specify the sector or industry of an holding or, basically
# anything.
#
# Each meta entry must have a match section matching the holding
# by name or ticker and an apply section used to specify 
# the attributes for that holding.
# Each attribute in the apply section can be specified in two ways.
# As a single value:
#
#   <attribute>: <value>
# 
# As a combination of values:
#
#   <attribute>: 
#       <value 1>: <percentage>
#       <value 2>: <percentage>
#       ...
#
# Specifying an attribute as a single value is equivalent to:
#
#   <attribute>: 
#       <value>: 100%
#
# If percentages don't sum up to 100% the remaining portion of the
# holding is considered "unknown" for that specific attribute.
# Similarly, holding which do now specify an attribute are considered
# "unknown" for that attribute.
#
# Attributes can be anything (i.e. you can put anything you want in
# <attribute>).
